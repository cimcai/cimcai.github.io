        We need an open, transdisciplinary, non-profit research initiative. This institute will integrate insights from philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, the arts, mathematics and AI into a unified framework, breaking down the conceptual barriers that have hindered progress in consciousness research. We envision this institute as a hub where academics, AI industry experts, and independent scholars conduct practical research in-house.
